Somewhat a tale of two halves - Keith Mansfield vs. Syd Dale. The real standouts here are "Morning Broadway" via
KM and "Man Friday" SD. The former is beat and flute heavy wonderment, put on a 45 by Jazzman; the latter is
the theme to Tarrant on TV but screams TV Theme in a good way. The Keith side wins out for me and there's a bunch
of good pop-psych style tunes that work pretty well. The Syd Dale is a little too Syd for my ears - outside of Man 
Friday, I’m not sure there’s much to write home about. Morning Broadway though is library music perfection - heavy 
hammond, drum workout, vocals and some aggressive flute playing. Not sure if the rest of the record makes this worth 
the price of admission but it is a corker. The following track “Pop Spiritual” has vibes and is good, but everything 
pales after that standout track. I think if you like the parping aspect to Syd Dale then you’d probably get on with 
the second side but it’s a little too Saturday night ITV if you know what I mean. If you’d told me that one of these 
tunes was played whilst the prize carousel spun I would not blink an eye.
